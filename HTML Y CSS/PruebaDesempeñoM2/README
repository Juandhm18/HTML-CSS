This project aims to deliver a portfolio that allows me to showcase my work to date, along with a way for you to contact me. In the index, you'll see my projects with a brief introduction about who I am. In the "About Me" tab, you can learn a little more about me, what I've studied, and what I'm passionate about. I'm constantly working on adding more knowledge to this list. Finally, I have a contact page where you can let me know any questions you may have about me or my work.

As for the design of the page, I was inspired by a landscape that somewhat resembles cyberpunk, so the design tried to be that way.
